Policy Iteration on a Custom Gridworld

This notebook is a simple walkthrough of policy iteration, one of the core algorithms in reinforcement learning.
I built my own small gridworld environment and implemented everything from scratch so I could really see how the algorithm works step-by-step.

What you’ll find here

A custom gridworld with rewards and terminal states

Policy evaluation + policy improvement written manually

A loop that keeps updating the policy until it stops changing

Prints/visuals that make it easy to follow what the agent is learning

Why I made it

I wanted to get past the “high-level explanation” of policy iteration and actually watch it converge in a small environment I controlled. Writing everything out helped me understand what’s happening under the hood much better than using a library.

How to use it

Open the notebook and run it top to bottom. It doesn’t need anything beyond basic Python packages.
